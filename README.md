# Shape Calculator (Geometry Tool)

This is a small project I made to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It lets you calculate areas and volumes of basic 2D and 3D shapes.  
I built it mainly for mobile screens, but it also works on desktop.

## Why I built this
I wanted to make a simple but useful website while learning web development.  
Also, this helps me understand formulas better by turning them into code.

## Future plans
- Better UI animations  
- Calculation history  
- Dark mode  
- More shapes  
- A cleaner code structure  
- Maybe a backend version once I learn it
